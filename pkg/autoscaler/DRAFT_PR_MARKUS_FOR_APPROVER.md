Ten substantial examples with Markus as primary reviewer:

1. [Add Revision ContainerConcurrency](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/1917) Reviewed the whole thing and had quite a few improving comments that eventually made it in the PR
2. [Deflake breaker tests](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/1807) Reviewed the whole thing and had quite a few improving comments that eventually made it in the PR. Proposed a change in design (see usage of the Breaker)
3. [Add a delay following inactivity before scaling to zero.](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/1906) Proposed more tests and a few nits.
4. [Activator Header Fixes](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/2047) Pointed out missing documentation and reviewed the whole thing.
5. [Amortize pod metrics when lameducking](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/2109) Questioned the design, got convinced, reviewed the whole thing and proposed accepted changes
6. [Fix race condition in breaker test (#1984)](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/2137) (Clarified some bits and lgtmed)
7. [Bump the activator to 3 replicas to test horizontal scalability.](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/2171) (A small PR but with wide ranging effects. Identified and fixed issues not directly visible in the code diff)
8. [Avoid emitting headers that later reject requests](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/2240) (Discussed about the implementation, suggested improvements)
9. [Provide an e2e test that asserts autoscaler stability](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/2345) (Discussion made the test richer and more stable)
10. [try to start shutdown without always waiting for a specific time](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/2365) (Iut I dug very deep into this to lead the contributor on the right path)
11. [Disable scale-to-zero during activation (#2155)](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/2386) (I discussed a change in the design of the PR, which ultimately resulted in a better quality)
